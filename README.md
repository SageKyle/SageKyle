### :man_technologist: About Me :


I am a Frontend Web developer 💻 from Nigeria.
I've always been fascinated by computers, how they work and technology in general, and the endless possibilities and opportunities they offer ✨. &nbsp;
I love to use computers to solve problems and make life easier for people around me.

- :telescope: I’m currently building a unique to-do/notes app that works offline and also has a speech recognition feature for recording notes.
- :seedling: I've been writing articles on web development ([you can check it out here](https://saje.hashnode.dev)), and it has been an interesting journey so far. It has provided a way for me to gain more in-depth knowledge on any topic I'm writing about.
- :zap: In my free time, I love to read technical articles, play around with trending or arcane concepts in web development, write an article, or read books,  📚 especially psychology and science-related 🌏.
- 👯 I would love to collaborate on building projects that require the skills I already know and challenge me to learn more and improve.
