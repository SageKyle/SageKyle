### :man_technologist: About Me :


I am a Front-end Web 💻 from Nigeria.
I've always been fascinated by computers, how they work and technology in general and the endless possibilities and opportunities it offers ✨. &nbsp;
I love to use computers to solve problems and make life easier for people around me. 

- :telescope: I’m currently learning Tailwind CSS and also building a unique task tracker/notes app with React, Firebase and Tailwind CSS. 
- :seedling: I recently started technical writing ([you can check it out here](https://saje.hashnode.dev)), and it has been an interesting journey so far. It has provided a way for me to gain an in-depth knowledge on any topic I'm writing about.
- :zap: In my free time, I either solve problems on Front-end Mentor, write an article or read books,  📚 especially psychology and science-related 🌏.
- 👯 I would love to collaborate on building projects that require the skills I already know and also challenge me to learn more and be better.
